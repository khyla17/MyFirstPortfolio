Project Description

This project is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as an aspiring web developer. The website is fully responsive and includes several sections like Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. It is designed with a modern, clean aesthetic and includes interactive features like dark mode and dynamic project cards.
